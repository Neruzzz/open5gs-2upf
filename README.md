# Open5GS 2-UPF cloud-edge deployment

This repository provides a complete deployment setup for a 5G standalone core using Open5GS (version **2.6.6**) and Amarisoft gNB. It supports a dual deployment architecture with two pairs of SMF/UPF components: one in the **cloud** and one at the **edge**. The UE dynamically selects the user plane route based on the **APN** configuration: one APN points to the cloud UPF, and another points to the edge UPF, enabling differentiated traffic handling and slicing.

‚ö†Ô∏è The version of Open5GS is **pinned to 2.6.6** in the Dockerfile to ensure compatibility. Using a different version may result in errors due to changes in configuration formats or APIs in newer releases.

This project builds upon the original work by Herle Supreeth:  
üîó [https://github.com/herlesupreeth/docker_open5gs](https://github.com/herlesupreeth/docker_open5gs)



## üìÅ Repository structure

Each folder corresponds to a network function or support module:

- `amf/` ‚Äì **Access and Mobility Management Function**: Handles UE registration, connection management, and mobility.
- `smf/` ‚Äì **Session Management Function**: Manages sessions, APN selection, and interaction with UPFs.
- `upf/` ‚Äì **User Plane Function**: Routes and forwards user traffic toward the internet or data network.
- `ausf/` ‚Äì **Authentication Server Function**: Authenticates UEs using information from UDM and security keys.
- `pcf/` ‚Äì **Policy Control Function**: Applies network policies to sessions (QoS, traffic rules).
- `udm/` ‚Äì **Unified Data Management**: Stores subscriber profiles (e.g., subscription, authentication credentials).
- `udr/` ‚Äì **Unified Data Repository**: Backend storage for UDM and PCF data.
- `nrf/` ‚Äì **Network Repository Function**: Allows service discovery between network functions.
- `nssf/` ‚Äì **Network Slice Selection Function**: Assigns slices based on UE subscription or request.
- `bsf/` ‚Äì **Binding Support Function**: Manages binding of IP addresses to subscribers for IP session continuity.
- `scp/` ‚Äì **Service Communication Proxy**: Manages HTTP/2 message routing between control plane functions.
- `webui/` ‚Äì **Web-based User Interface**: Allows operator to manage subscribers, devices, and sessions visually.

Additional components:

- `metrics/`: Prometheus exporter for monitoring Open5GS services.
- `mqtt/`: MQTT config file for the broker.
- `scripts/`: Shell scripts for image building, service orchestration, and automation.
- `SIM/`: Contains SIM profiles and parameters used in the lab (IMSI, K, OPc, etc.) and commands to program a SIM for slicing support.
- `UERANSIM/`: Simulation tool to emulate UE and gNB behavior for local testing.
- `.env`: Docker environment configuration.
- `deployment.yaml`: Main Docker Compose file used to launch the architecture.



## ‚öôÔ∏è Initial setup: cloud and edge nodes

This project can be deployed in two ways:
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud-only** deployment (all Open5GS services run in the cloud)
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud + üñ•Ô∏è Edge** deployment (SMF and UPF are replicated at edge and the route to internet selected via APN)

The following steps must be applied to **each node** involved in the deployment (either cloud or edge), with some configuration differences depending on the role.



### 1. Clone the repository

On each node (cloud and edge), clone this repository and navigate into it:

```bash
git clone <this_repo_url>
cd open5gs-2upf
```


### 2. Configure the `.env` file

Each node requires a local `.env` file. The following variables must be set depending on the role.

#### ‚òÅÔ∏è üñ•Ô∏è Common to Cloud and Edge

Edit the `.env` file:

```bash
nano .env
```

Set the host IP of the current machine:

```env
DOCKER_HOST_IP=192.168.X.X
```

Also configure the UPF advertising IPs:

```env
UPF_ADVERTISE_IP=192.168.X.X      # Cloud node
UPF2_ADVERTISE_IP=192.168.Y.Y     # Edge node
```

> On the **cloud node**, only `UPF_ADVERTISE_IP` needs to be changed.  
> On the **edge node**, only `UPF2_ADVERTISE_IP` must be changed.

To ensure that the system is able to resolve domain names, ensure the DNS IP is changed in both machines:

```env
SMF_DNS1=192.168.50.1 # If your DNS if different change this
SMF_DNS2=192.168.50.1
```
> Change both in both machines (cloud and edge)

#### üñ•Ô∏è Only on the edge node

To ensure that the edge services can discover the cloud-deployed components, update the following IPs to point to the **cloud node**:

```env
SCP_IP=192.168.CLOUD_IP
NRF_IP=192.168.CLOUD_IP
```

No need to modify these on the cloud node.


### 3. Build the Open5GS Docker image

Build the Docker image for Open5GS (only required once per node):

```bash
cd scripts
./build.sh
```

This script compiles Open5GS version **2.6.6** and creates the Docker image.



### 4. Proceed to Amarisoft gNB configuration

With the environment configured and Docker images built,  
you can now configure the **Amarisoft gNB** to connect to the cloud-deployed AMF.



## üì° Amarisoft gNB configuration

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: If SDRs are not detected after a reboot or crash, you must reinitialize them manually:
>
> ```bash
> cd trx_sdr/kernel/
> sudo ./init.sh
> ```

To connect Amarisoft gNB to the cloud AMF:

1. On the Amarisoft machine, go to:

```bash
cd enb/config
```

2. Copy or create a new config file from a standalone profile:

```bash
cp gnb-sa-* gnb-sa-open5gs
```

3. Edit the file `gnb-sa-open5gs` and set the IP and port of the AMF and the gNB machine IP:

```c
  amf_list: [
    {
      /* address of AMF for NGAP connection. Must be modified if the AMF runs on a different host */
      amf_addr: "192.168.x.x:38412",
    },
  ],
  /* GTP bind address (=address of the ethernet interface connected to the AMF). Must be modified if the AMF runs on a different host. */
  gtp_addr: "192.168.x.x"
```

4. Create or update the symlink `enb.cfg`:

```bash
ln -sf gnb-sa-open5gs enb.cfg
```

5. Restart the Amarisoft LTE service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart lte.service
```

To debug Amarisoft and access the interactive menu:

```bash
screen -r
```


## üöÄ Deploying the Docker services

To launch the Open5GS services on each node, use the predefined scripts available in the `scripts/` folder.

### üõ†Ô∏è Available scripts

- `runCloud.sh` ‚Äì for deploying services on the **cloud node**
- `runEdge.sh` ‚Äì for deploying services on the **edge node**

To execute them do the following on the desired node:

```bash
cd scripts # In both nodes
bash runCloud.sh # On the cloud node
bash runEdge.sh # On the edge node
```

These scripts internally execute a `docker compose` command like:

```bash
docker compose -f ../deployment.yaml up service1 service2 service3 ...
```

### ‚úèÔ∏è Customizing services

If you want to deploy a different set of services:

1. You can **edit the script** directly (`scripts/runCloud.sh` or `scripts/runEdge.sh`),  
2. Or you can run the command manually from the project root with your desired services:

```bash
docker compose -f deployment.yaml up <your_services_here>
```

This approach provides flexibility to deploy only the components you need on each node.

> Once the 5G core services are deployed in the cloud and the edge you will need to subscribe the UEs to the network using the WebUI service.



## üì≤ Subscribe UE

Once the deployment is up, you need to **subscribe the UEs** to the network so they can register and access services.  
This is done using the web application provided by the **WebUI** service.

Follow these steps to access and use the WebUI:


### 1. Forward port 3000

If you're connected to the **cloud machine via remote connection in VSCode**, forward port `3000` as shown below:  
![Port forwarding in VSCode](docs/img/portvsc.png "Port forwarding in VSCode")

If you're connected via SSH, run the following command on your local machine:

```bash
ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 user@remote-ip
```

> Replace `user` and `remote-ip` with your SSH username and IP.

If you are already on the machine running the deployment, proceed to the next step.


### 2. Access the WebUI in your browser

Open your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```


### 3. Log in to the WebUI

Use the default credentials:

- **Username**: `admin`  
- **Password**: `1423`

![Login page](docs/img/login.png "WebUI Login page")



### 4. Open the subscriber creation page

Once inside the WebUI, go to the **Subscriber** section and click the **Add** button:

![Add subscriber button](docs/img/subutton.png "Add subscriber in WebUI")



### 5. Enter SIM card information

Fill in the following fields using the data from your SIM card provider:

- **IMSI**
- **Key (K or Ki)**
- **OPC (or OP)**

You only need to fill those three fields.  
This information can also be found in the `SIM/sim_cards.csv` file provided in this project.

![SIM card information](docs/img/siminfo.png "Enter SIM card details")



### 6. Configure the slice and APNs

By default, we use **one slice**. To configure it:

- Scroll down and fill in the **Slice SST** and **SD** with the values used in your cloud SMF configuration.

![Slice configuration section](docs/img/sliceconfig1.png)

Then, add a second **APN** by clicking the second `+` icon from the left:

![Add another APN](docs/img/APN1.png)

Fill it just like the first one, but use the APN name configured for the **edge UPF**, typically something like:

```text
edge
```

![Edge APN configuration](docs/img/APN2.png)

> üß† For more details on configuring multiple slices, refer to the section: [Two Slices Deployment](#-two-slices-deployment)

### 7. Configure APN on the UE

To connect to the network, your device must have the same **APN name** configured in the WebUI for the subscribed SIM.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
> - The **APN name must match exactly** what was set in the WebUI (e.g., `cloud`, `edge`)  
> - The **APN type** must be set to: `default,internet` (no spaces)
> Repeat these steps for each of the APNs configured in the WebUI.

Configuration steps may vary slightly depending on the phone model or Android/iOS version.

#### ü§ñ Android

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Network & Internet** ‚Üí **Mobile Network**  
2. Tap on **Access Point Names (APNs)**  
3. Tap **+** or **Add new APN**
4. Fill in the fields:
   - **Name**: (any friendly name, e.g., `Cloud 5G`)
   - **APN**: `cloud` or `edge` (depending on what you set in WebUI)
   - **APN type**: `default,internet`
5. Save the APN and select it as active

#### üçé iOS

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Cellular**  
2. If your device has multiple SIMs, select the active SIM (e.g., **Primary**, **Secondary**)  
3. Tap **Cellular Data Network**
4. Under **Cellular Data**, configure:
   - **APN**: `cloud` or `edge` (must match exactly what was set in WebUI)
   - **Username**: *(leave empty)*
   - **Password**: *(leave empty)*
5. Exit settings (you may need to restart the device)
6. Make sure the configured SIM is selected as the default for mobile data:
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Cellular** ‚Üí **Cellular Data** and select the correct SIM
7. Wait a few seconds and verify the device connects to the network

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The deployment has been tested with Android phones. **It could fail if you use iOS**.


## üç∞ Two Slices Deployment

This section explains how to configure and subscribe a UE to **two different network slices** with:

- `SST: 1`, `SD: 000001` ‚Üí for the **cloud slice** (APN: `cloud`)
- `SST: 1`, `SD: 000002` ‚Üí for the **edge slice** (APN: `edge`)

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Modify AMF, SMFs and NSSF YAML files

In order to support multiple slices, you must modify configuration files for **AMF**, **NSSF**, and **both SMFs**.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è All of these changes apply only to the **cloud side** unless otherwise specified.

---

#### AMF (`amf.yaml`)

The **AMF** handles UE registration, connection management, and initial slice selection. It must be configured to recognize the available slices. Uncomment the `s_nssai` section of the `plmn_support` block to include both `SD` values:

```yaml
plmn_support:
  - plmn_id:
      mcc: MCC
      mnc: MNC
    s_nssai:
      - sst: 1
        sd: 000001
      #- sst: 1
      #  sd: 000002
```

> ‚úÖ This update is only needed in the **cloud-side AMF**.

---

#### NSSF (`nssf.yaml`)

The **NSSF** (Network Slice Selection Function) manages slice discovery and selection logic.  
You must **uncomment** the slice definition with `SD: 000002` in the `nsi` section:

```yaml
nsi:
  - addr: NRF_IP
    port: 7777
    s_nssai:
      sst: 1
      sd: 000001
  - addr: NRF_IP
    port: 7777
    s_nssai:
      sst: 1
      sd: 000002
```

> ‚úÖ This file must also be updated **only in the cloud deployment**.

---

#### ‚òÅÔ∏è SMF - Cloud Side (`smf.yaml`)

In the cloud-side SMF (`smf.yaml`), define the following under the `info` section:

```yaml
info:
  - s_nssai:
      - sst: 1
        sd: 000001
        dnn:
          - cloud
```

This tells the SMF to handle traffic for the **cloud slice** with APN `cloud`.


#### üñ•Ô∏è SMF - Edge Side (`smf2.yaml`)

In the edge-side SMF (`smf2.yaml`), define the edge slice in the `info` section:

```yaml
info:
  - s_nssai:
      - sst: 1
        sd: 000002
        dnn:
          - edge
```

This connects the edge SMF to the **edge slice** with APN `edge`.


### WebUI configuration

The first part of the configuration is the same as in the one slice deployment. Put the SIM values onto the user information in the WebUI. Follow the steps until [Enter SIM card information](#5-enter-sim-card-information) the keep on going with the following:

1. Add the information of the APN in the first slice:

![Slice 1 configuration](docs/img/slice1.png)


2. Then add a slice using the third `+` button from the left:

![Add another slice](docs/img/APN1.png)

3. Finally, add the second APN to the second slice changing the `SD` value to `000002`

![Slice 2 configuration](docs/img/slice2.png)

> **Note:** The configuration in the UE is the same as for the one slice deployment unless you changed some APN name. Also the sim might need to be programed to support multislicing. You can refer to `SIM/NSSAIConfig` to know the commands to use onto the SIM.

### Deployment

The setup is deployed as in the [previous example](#-deploying-the-docker-services). If you changed the files while the project was running you have to restart all the services. YAML files are uploaded to the container binaries at start so the changes wont take effect until open5gs services are restarted.
